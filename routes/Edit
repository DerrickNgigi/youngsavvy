                                Africa has always been isolated from the rest of the world in regard to industry growth. This has long
                                been blamed on the lack of huge capital investment and political will and an enabling environment for
                                the growth of industries as in Asian countries such as China and Singapore.
                                This is no longer the case as Technology has however become a great equalizer. Having a laptop
                                computer right now in the hands of your child in Kenya is basically an opportunity equal to your
                                counterpart parents having a laptop in the laps on a kid in Asia, Europe and even the Americas.
                                With the same ‘resource’ dispensation, the opportunity ‘advantage’ is now almost entirely crushed on
                                developed countries. How we use the now easily available resource now becomes the difference maker.
                                This basically boils down to the level of knowledge we have on computers, what they can do and how to
                                do it.
                                Our college degrees even in ‘Computer Science and Engineering’ still focus on 1980’s technology. Not to
                                mention our primary schools and high schools that are still teaching things that are completely
                                irrelevant to the modern world. We all have that one thing we did study in school that we can figure out
                                how it impacts our lives today, right?
